<p>JK ROCKS ROCK YOU CAN NEVER HAVE TOO MANY ROCKS<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">.</a>
<p>inside the little box you will have found even more rocks.
<p>these are special rocks because like leo the lion, they are 4 u.
<p>the little paper attached will explain it better than i can, but basically, it's your birthstone. or at least one of your birthstones. technically your "official" birthstone is ruby, and this orange rock thing is the "alternate" birthstone for july, but the little gift shoppe in the rock museum i went to in Elmhurst Illinois (birthplace and childhood home of my father) didnt have rubies. if they did i totally would have bought you one ofc. but yeah. on the plus side, you get this nice little thing explaining the attributes of the rock, PLUS, a sick bracelet, PLUUUUSSS a sick necklace. you can actually replace the rock inside the necklace with one of the other ones. i chose the one i thought was nicest and put it in the necklace for you but you can totally swap em out if you want! lmk how you like it!

<p><a href="abbey5.html">>>okay, NOW i'm done with the rocks</a></p>

<p> ps, the rock museum was super cool. they had a TON of art made with just rocks. it was crazy. super finely detailed mosaics and stuff, they looked just like paintings but they were made entirely of different colored rocks. it's probably not worth a visit all the way up there just to see it, but if you're ever in the area, definitely check it out! <a href="http://lizzadromuseum.org/">http://lizzadromuseum.org/</a>
