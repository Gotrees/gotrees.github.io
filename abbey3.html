<p>okay, cool.
<p>here we go
<p>basically, the way i organized all this is like each box contains curios from different exotic lands. (ie. the midwest, the amazon (dot com), and irvine, california)
<p>so, this one is obviously 𝕋ℍ𝔼 𝕄𝕀𝔻𝕎𝔼𝕊𝕋 𝔹𝕆𝕏, aka 𝒜𝒷𝒷ℯ𝓎 ℛℴ𝒸𝓀𝓈! (get it? ROCKS bc it contains a lot of various rocks? yeah.)
<p>i guess first ill talk about the coffee mug. 
<p>since you are a bright young lady who knows how to read, you probably have already gathered that it comes from the Art Institute in Chicago. I've already told you a bunch about it, I think. It's an amazing place, and i think you would love it there. So many cool famous paintings and also a lot of cool unfamous paintings. And i know u've got what it takes end up in there some day, Abbey!
<p>in front of the museum are two very noble metal lion statues. they reminded me of you. i guess lions will forever remind me of you, leo! but anyway, that's why I chose this specific mug for you. one day hopefully you can meet those lions yourself!
<p>next, inside the cup...
<p>yes, i really did get you a rock. happy birthday!
<p>well, actually, it's a bunch of rocks. i thought they were cool. they were from a beach right next to an abandoned coal mine in Minnesota

<p> it was really pretty there so naturally i thought of you and decided to grab you a few rocks
<p>i dont think i was supposed to, but they were cool and had a backstory so i did anyway
<p>here's a few pictures of me awkwardly smiling at the spot where i got the rocks, and also another really pretty picture i got at a place nearby, and also a sign explaining the rocks
